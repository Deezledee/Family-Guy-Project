                Our player, Peter Griffin, despises his daughter, Meg, so bad that he would like to dodge her at all costs!<br />
                In order for him to achieve the desired wish, he must move fast enough within a time-range of 60 seconds.<br />
                He begins with three lives, which means, more opportunities for him to win.<br />
                If he manages to dodge all Megs by the end of the countdown, he wins.<br />
                However, once he has hit three Megs, he loses.<br />
                <br />
                Watch out carefully:<br />
                The more time passes, the faster it gets!
